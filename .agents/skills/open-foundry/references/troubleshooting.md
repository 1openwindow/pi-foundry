# open-foundry skill troubleshooting

The LLM consults this file when `azd deploy` or `verify.mjs` fails. Match the error symptom in the left column, give the user the one-line cause and the one command in the right column.

## Bootstrap / template

| Symptom | Cause + action |
|---|---|
| `bootstrap.mjs` refuses to write because `azure.yaml` exists | User repo already has a non-open-foundry `azure.yaml`. Ask before replacing; rerun `bootstrap.mjs --force` only after explicit confirmation, and back up the old file first. |
| `Dockerfile` contains `<runtime-image>` literal at deploy time | bootstrap was run without `--runtime-image`. Rerun: `bootstrap.mjs --runtime-image <acr>/pi-foundry-runtime:<tag>` |
| `agent.yaml` / `agent.manifest.yaml` contains `<agent-name>` literal | Same root cause: bootstrap not run, or run with wrong arg. Rerun with `--agent-name <name>`. |

## azd env

| Symptom | Cause + action |
|---|---|
| `azd env get-values` is empty | No environment selected. `azd env new <name>` or `azd env select <name>`. |
| `azd up` fails: `Could not find ... infra/main.bicep` | This thin layout has no `infra/` to provision. Use `azd deploy`, not `azd up`. |
| Deploy fails: `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ID is not set` | `azd deploy` needs the project's full ARM resource id. `configure-env.mjs` derives it; if it couldn't, pass `--azure-ai-project-id /subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<account>/projects/<project>`. |
| postdeploy fails: `AZURE_TENANT_ID is not set` | The agent deployed but a postdeploy hook needs the tenant. Set it (`configure-env.mjs` derives it) then rerun `azd deploy`: `azd env set AZURE_TENANT_ID=<tenant-id>`. |
| Deploy fails with "image pull unauthorized" | Foundry identities lack ACR pull. Run `azd ai agent doctor --no-prompt` and assign AcrPull on the registry. |
| Invoke returns "configuration: no foundry provider" or model 401 | `PI_OPENAI_*` not set in azd env, or `PI_ARGS` missing `--provider foundry --model <model>`. Reconfigure via `configure-env.mjs`. |
| Keyless (`OF_MODEL_AUTH=managed-identity`) invoke returns model 401/403 | The agent's **Instance Identity** lacks a data-plane role on the model account. Run `node <skill>/scripts/grant-model-access.mjs` (grants `Cognitive Services OpenAI User`), then `azd deploy`. |
| Container fails readiness | `OF_MOCK` not set and `OF_OPENAI_API_KEY` missing → runtime rejects start. Set `OF_MOCK=1` for smoke, set the API key, or use `OF_MODEL_AUTH=managed-identity` for keyless auth. |
| azd env contains custom `AGENT_*` or `FOUNDRY_*` variables (other than `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`) | Foundry reserves these prefixes. Remove them with `azd env set <NAME>=` to clear, or rename. |

## Deploy

| Symptom | Cause + action |
|---|---|
| `azd deploy` succeeds but `verify.mjs` returns nothing or times out | The agent may still be activating, or the task is slow. `verify.mjs` already streams (SSE), so long tasks survive the gateway idle timeout — if it still hangs, retry and check `azd ai agent monitor <name> --tail 100 --type console`. |
| `agent.yaml is missing` during deploy | Foundry deploy currently reads `agent.yaml` from repo root. The skill puts it there by design. If it was deleted, rerun `bootstrap.mjs`. |
| Resource tier rejected | Hosted Agent only allows cpu/memory pairs `0.25/0.5Gi, 0.5/1Gi, 1/2Gi, 2/4Gi`. Edit `azure.yaml` and `agent.yaml` to match. |
| Container exceeds reserved env restriction | Some `environment_variables` entry uses `AGENT_*` or `FOUNDRY_*` (other than `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`). Remove it from `agent.yaml` / `agent.manifest.yaml`. |

## Invoke

| Symptom | Cause + action |
|---|---|
| Response includes `"mock": true` when user expected real model | `OF_MOCK=1` is still set. `azd env set OF_MOCK=0` and `azd deploy` to roll a new revision. |
| Session continuity not working | Pass the same `agent_session_id`. `verify.mjs --session <id>` reuses sessions. |
| HTTP 408 `{"error":{"code":"Timeout"}}` (header `Apim-Request-Id`) on tasks longer than ~120s | Foundry's APIM gateway enforces a ~120s **idle** (no-bytes) timeout; a non-streaming request holds the connection silent for the whole task, so anything past ~120s is cut at the gateway before the container's `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` ever applies. Use the SSE path (`verify.mjs` streams by default; send `Accept: text/event-stream`): the runtime emits an SSE keepalive every `SSE_HEARTBEAT_MS` (default 20s) so silent phases (tool runs, uploads) keep the idle timer alive. `azd ai agent invoke` does not consume SSE, so it suits short (<~120s) tasks; use `verify.mjs` for longer ones. |

## Runtime image

| Symptom | Cause + action |
|---|---|
| `FROM <runtime-image>` fails at build time | Either bootstrap wasn't given `--runtime-image`, or the user's identity can't pull from that ACR. `az acr login -n <acr>` and rerun. |
| Skills don't load inside container | Pi reads from `/workspace/.agents/skills/`. Ensure the user's repo has skills there and Dockerfile does `COPY . /workspace` (it does by default). |
| Workspace empty inside container | `.dockerignore` excluded too much. Compare against `templates/.dockerignore`. |

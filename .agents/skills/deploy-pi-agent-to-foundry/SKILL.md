name: deploy-pi-agent-to-foundry
description: Helps initialize, validate, deploy, invoke, and troubleshoot an existing Pi agent on Microsoft Foundry Hosted Agents using the pi-foundry azd-native in-repo adapter. Use when the user wants to add Foundry deployment to a local Pi agent repo, configure azd/PI_* settings, run adapter doctor, deploy with azd up, verify remote invocations, or debug deployment, session, streaming, and artifact issues.

# Deploy Pi Agent to Foundry

Use this skill as the UX/onboarding layer for the `pi-foundry` azd-native adapter. The user should be able to say things like:

- "把我这个 Pi agent 部署到 Foundry。"
- "帮我给当前 repo 加 Foundry 部署。"
- "帮我检查为什么 azd up 失败。"
- "跑一下远程 artifact demo。"

Your job is to keep the user on one path:

```text
existing Pi agent repo -> thin azd adapter -> runtime base image -> azd up -> Foundry Hosted Agent
```

Do **not** create a wrapper repo. Do **not** copy user assets into a separate deployment repo. Do **not** vendor pi-foundry runtime source into the user's repo.

## Mental model

Explain the product as three layers:

```text
User-owned Pi agent repo
  - .agents/skills/
  - prompts/
  - MCP config
  - demo-workspace/
  - tool/model credentials via azd env
        |
        v
Thin azd adapter in the same repo
  - azure.yaml
  - agent.yaml
  - agent.manifest.yaml
  - .dockerignore
  - .azd/pi-foundry/Dockerfile
  - .azd/pi-foundry/doctor.mjs
  - .azd/pi-foundry/postdeploy.mjs
        |
        v
Versioned pi-foundry runtime image
  - Foundry Invocations bridge
  - Pi RPC lifecycle
  - sessions
  - streaming
  - artifact publishing
        |
        v
Microsoft Foundry Hosted Agents
```

Default recommendation:

- Stay in the user's existing Pi agent repo.
- Add deployment configuration only.
- Use `node .azd/pi-foundry/doctor.mjs` for preflight validation.
- Use `azd up` as the canonical deploy command.
- Keep user business code, skills, prompts, and MCP config unchanged unless explicitly asked.
- Use a versioned pi-foundry runtime base image.

## First steps every time

1. Identify the current directory type:
   - Existing Pi agent repo: has `.agents/skills/`, `prompts/`, `mcp.config.json`, or `demo-workspace/`.
   - Already adapted repo: has `azure.yaml` and `.azd/pi-foundry/Dockerfile`.
   - pi-foundry development checkout: has `templates/azd-native/`.
2. Inspect status with safe commands:
   - `pwd`
   - `git status --short` when inside a git repo
   - `find . -maxdepth 3 ...` for relevant files if needed
3. Initialize with azd from the user's repo. `azd init` warns before copying template files into a non-empty directory.
4. Before deploy, run from the user repo:
   - `node .azd/pi-foundry/doctor.mjs`

## Core workflow: existing Pi agent -> Foundry deployment

Use this when the user has a local Pi agent and wants it on Foundry.

### Inputs to collect

Ask only for missing values:

- Existing Pi agent path, default to current directory if it looks like a Pi agent.
- Agent/deployment name, e.g. `media-report-agent`.
- ACR endpoint, e.g. `<registry>.azurecr.io`.
- Runtime image, usually `<registry>.azurecr.io/pi-foundry-runtime:0.1.0`; set it as `PI_FOUNDRY_RUNTIME_IMAGE` in `azd env`.
- Foundry/model values later, only when configuring deploy:
  - `PI_OPENAI_BASE_URL`
  - `PI_OPENAI_MODEL`
  - `PI_OPENAI_API_KEY`
  - optional artifact storage values.

Never print secrets. Do not write secrets into repo files.

### Install adapter

From the existing Pi agent repo, initialize with azd:

```bash
cd <existing-pi-agent-path>
azd init --template <pi-foundry-azd-template> . --environment <agent-name>
```

For local development before the template is published as a standalone repo, use the local template path:

```bash
azd init --template ~/repos/pi-foundry/templates/azd-native . --environment <agent-name>
```

`azd init` warns when the current directory is not empty and asks for confirmation before copying template files into the repo.

Explain clearly that this adds deployment configuration files only:

```text
azure.yaml
agent.yaml
agent.manifest.yaml
.dockerignore
.azd/pi-foundry/Dockerfile
.azd/pi-foundry/README.md
.azd/pi-foundry/doctor.mjs
.azd/pi-foundry/postdeploy.mjs
```

It should not modify `.agents/skills/`, prompts, MCP config, demo workspace, or user business code. Existing deployment files are skipped unless `--overwrite` is explicitly supplied.

## Runtime image

The adapter expects a published pi-foundry runtime base image. If a runtime image is not available yet, build one from the pi-foundry repo.

Local Docker build:

```bash
PI_FOUNDRY_RUNTIME_IMAGE=<registry>.azurecr.io/pi-foundry-runtime:0.1.0 npm run runtime:build
```

ACR remote build when local Docker is unavailable:

```bash
npm run runtime:acr-build -- \
  --registry <registry>.azurecr.io \
  --image pi-foundry-runtime:0.1.0
```

Known-good internal runtime image:

```text
crce6hg4ngzj3as.azurecr.io/pi-foundry-runtime:0.1.0
```

## Configure Foundry/model environment

Use `azd env` in the user's existing Pi agent repo. Do not commit secrets.

Typical values:

```bash
azd env new <env-name>
azd env set AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT '<registry>.azurecr.io'
azd env set PI_FOUNDRY_RUNTIME_IMAGE '<registry>.azurecr.io/pi-foundry-runtime:0.1.0'
azd env set PI_MOCK 0
azd env set REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS 600000
azd env set ENABLE_DIAGNOSTICS 0
azd env set 'PI_ARGS=--mode rpc --no-session --provider foundry --model <model>'
azd env set PI_OPENAI_BASE_URL 'https://<account>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/v1'
azd env set PI_OPENAI_MODEL '<model>'
azd env set PI_OPENAI_API_KEY '<secret>'
```

Artifact publishing, if needed:

```bash
azd env set ARTIFACT_PUBLISH_MODE static-web
azd env set ARTIFACT_STORAGE_ACCOUNT '<storage-account>'
azd env set ARTIFACT_STATIC_WEB_ENDPOINT 'https://<storage-account>.<zone>.web.core.windows.net'
azd env set 'ARTIFACT_STATIC_WEB_CONTAINER=$web'
azd env set ARTIFACT_BLOB_PREFIX '<agent-name>'
```

Warn the user:

- Avoid custom `AGENT_*` and `FOUNDRY_*` variables; Foundry reserves those prefixes.
- Prefer `*.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/v1` for the OpenAI-compatible endpoint unless their environment requires another endpoint.
- `.azure/` and `.env` must remain uncommitted.

## Doctor and deploy

From the user's existing Pi agent repo:

```bash
node .azd/pi-foundry/doctor.mjs
azd up
```

The adapter's `azd up` workflow runs:

```text
node .azd/pi-foundry/doctor.mjs
azd package --all
azd deploy --all
node .azd/pi-foundry/postdeploy.mjs
```

The postdeploy script prints the invoke command and attempts artifact RBAC automation when `ARTIFACT_PUBLISH_MODE=static-web`.

## Verify remote behavior

Basic invocation:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke <agent-name> \
  --protocol invocations \
  --version <version> \
  --new-session \
  --timeout 900 \
  'Say exactly: ok'
```

Expected response includes JSON with roughly:

```json
{
  "output": "ok",
  "mock": false
}
```

Artifact demo, from a pi-foundry checkout if using the current repo script:

```bash
scripts/demo-remote-artifact.sh <agent-name> <version>
```

Expected behavior:

- response includes markdown artifact links or a structured `artifacts` array
- static website artifact URLs return HTTP 200

## Troubleshooting playbook

Start from the user's existing Pi agent repo:

```bash
node .azd/pi-foundry/doctor.mjs
azd ai agent doctor --no-prompt
azd ai agent show <agent-name> --output json --no-prompt
azd ai agent monitor <agent-name> --tail 100 --type console
```

Common issues and actions:

### Deployment succeeds but invoke fails

Check:

- `PI_MOCK=0`
- `PI_ARGS` includes `--mode rpc --provider foundry --model <model>`
- `PI_OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in `azd env`, not committed files
- `PI_OPENAI_BASE_URL` is the OpenAI-compatible endpoint, often `https://<account>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/v1`
- Hosted Agent version passed to `azd ai agent invoke` is the current deployed version

### Readiness or container startup fails

Check:

- thin adapter Dockerfile uses the intended pi-foundry runtime image
- `azure.yaml` startup command is `/app/runtime/official-invocations/entrypoint.sh`
- public container port convention is `8088`
- `GET /readiness` must return HTTP 200

### Artifact links missing or 403/404

Check:

- `ARTIFACT_PUBLISH_MODE=static-web`
- `ARTIFACT_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` and `ARTIFACT_STATIC_WEB_ENDPOINT` are set
- postdeploy ran successfully
- agent identities have `Storage Blob Data Contributor`

Remember: local `/artifacts/<path>` is not exposed through Foundry front door; remote clickable artifacts are published to Azure Storage Static Website.

### ACR/image pull issues

Check ACR permissions for Foundry identities. Run `node .azd/pi-foundry/doctor.mjs` and `azd ai agent doctor --no-prompt` first. If needed, inspect deployment/agent identities using `azd ai agent show <agent-name> --output json --no-prompt` and assign appropriate ACR pull/read roles.

### User asks whether to create a wrapper repo

Default answer: no. The user-facing product path is azd-native in-repo deployment. A wrapper repo creates source-of-truth confusion and is not part of the recommended UX.

## Documentation to consult when needed

Read these project docs when the user asks for details or when troubleshooting needs more context:

- `README.md` — top-level quickstart and runtime modes
- `docs/azd-native-ux.md` — azd-native in-repo adapter UX direction
- `docs/runtime-image.md` — runtime base image build/smoke/publish flow
- `docs/artifacts.md` — artifact publishing details
- `docs/demo-checklist.md` — current azd-native demo commands
- `DEPLOY.md` — remote Foundry invocation and deployment troubleshooting
- `docs/handoff.md` — current known-good internal deployment state

## Communication style

- Keep the user on the azd-native happy path.
- State assumptions before running mutating commands.
- Ask for missing names/endpoints/paths only when necessary.
- Translate tool output into concrete next actions.
- Treat adapter doctor output as the primary source of actionable environment feedback.

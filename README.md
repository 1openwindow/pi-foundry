# pi-foundry

Deploy an existing Pi agent repo to **Microsoft Foundry Hosted Agents** with a
minimal, standard `azd` layout.

You bring the Pi agent (skills, prompts, MCP config, model settings).
pi-foundry provides two things, and nothing else:

1. **`pi-foundry-runtime`** — a versioned container image that owns the
   Foundry Invocations protocol, Pi RPC, session mapping, streaming, and
   health/readiness.
2. **A Pi skill** at `.agents/skills/pi-foundry/` that bootstraps 5 standard
   `azd` files into your repo and runs `azd up`.

Your repo stays the source of truth. No private framework directory is
installed. If you stop using pi-foundry you delete 5 files and you're out.

```

## Quickstart

In any Pi session inside your Pi agent repo, ask:

> 把我这个 Pi agent 部署到 Foundry。

The skill confirms agent name + runtime image, then runs the four primitives
below. Run them by hand if you prefer:

```bash
SKILL=path/to/pi-foundry/.agents/skills/pi-foundry

node $SKILL/scripts/bootstrap.mjs       --agent-name <name> --runtime-image <acr>/pi-foundry-runtime:<tag>
node $SKILL/scripts/configure-env.mjs   --env-name <env> --agent-name <name> --model <model> --base-url <url> --api-key-env PI_OPENAI_API_KEY
azd up
node $SKILL/scripts/verify.mjs
```

You need: `azd` with the `azure.ai.agents` extension, a Foundry project, a
published `pi-foundry-runtime` image your project can pull, and a Foundry
OpenAI-compatible endpoint + model + an API key (or keyless managed-identity
auth via `PI_MODEL_AUTH=managed-identity`).

The skill never hardcodes a runtime image, model, or API endpoint — you
provide them once per deployment.

## Runtime contract

The runtime image owns these environment variables. Source of truth is
`src/contract.mjs`; the skill's `references/contract.json` is regenerated
from it via `npm run emit:contract`.

| Variable | Required when | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PI_OPENAI_API_KEY` / `PI_OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `PI_OPENAI_MODEL` | live (`PI_MOCK!=1`) | OpenAI-compatible triple |
| `PI_ARGS` | optional | defaults to `--mode rpc --no-session`; skill adds `--provider foundry --model <model>` |
| `PI_MOCK` | optional | `1` = run without a real model (smoke) |
| `PI_MODEL_AUTH` | optional | `apikey` (default) or `managed-identity` (keyless) |

Reserved (Foundry-owned, do not redefine): `AGENT_*`, `FOUNDRY_*`
(exception: `FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT`).

When `PI_MOCK` is unset and any of the live triple is missing, the runtime
**fails fast** at startup. Inside the container:

```bash
pi-foundry contract   # full contract JSON
pi-foundry doctor     # exit 1 + JSON report when required env is missing
```

## Repository layout

```
src/                            invocations host, contract SoT, in-container CLI
Dockerfile.runtime              builds pi-foundry-runtime (single Node process)
.agents/skills/pi-foundry/      the skill (SKILL.md + templates + scripts)
scripts/                        runtime build/smoke, emit:contract
test/                           npm test (node --test)
docs/                           runtime-image, reference/
```

## Local development

```bash
npm test                                       # unit + SSE integration, no Docker
PI_MOCK=1 npm run start:backend                # local mock backend
npm run runtime:build && npm run runtime:smoke # build + smoke image (Docker)
npm run emit:contract                          # refresh skill's contract.json
```

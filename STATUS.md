## Goal

Run Pi as a Microsoft Foundry Hosted Agent and provide a reusable **Bring Your Own Pi Agent to Foundry** skill-managed adapter.

The current recommended architecture is:

```text
Official SDK Invocations host for Foundry deployment
Internal Node backend for Pi RPC, sessions, streaming, and artifact publishing
```

See [docs/handoff.md](./docs/handoff.md) for the current handoff and [docs/demo-checklist.md](./docs/demo-checklist.md) for demo commands.

## Current status

Complete:

- Official SDK host + internal Node backend local smoke works
- Local Docker image uses the official SDK host
- Foundry Hosted Agent deployment works
- Invocations protocol shape works
- Remote real pi invocation works
- Remote session continuity works
- Static website artifact publishing works
- Earlier skill/azd-compatible in-repo adapter prototype worked end-to-end with `clean-pi-agent` deployed as `pi-agent` v1
- Runtime base image built through ACR remote build: `crce6hg4ngzj3as.azurecr.io/pi-foundry-runtime:0.1.0`

Current known-good remote agent:

- `pi-agent` version `1`: validates the earlier in-repo adapter story; deployed from the clean `~/repos/clean-pi-agent` repo with `azd up` and no wrapper repo.

Historical/internal validation agents:

- `media-report-foundry` version `1`: validated the old existing Pi agent import/wrapper story. This is no longer user-facing.
- `pi-foundry-official-invocations` version `3`: validated the official `azure-ai-agentserver-invocations` host as the public protocol layer with the Node Pi backend.
- `pi-foundry` version `4`/later validated the historical direct Node Invocations proof; that deployment path has been removed from the repo.

Artifact static website for the internal deployment:

```text
https://pifoundryeus2web.z20.web.core.windows.net/
```

## Project layout

Root:

```text
/home/zihch/repos/pi-foundry
```

Important files:

```text

```

## HTTP API

Implemented endpoints:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /readiness`
- `GET /invocations/docs/openapi.json`
- `GET /artifacts/<path>`
- `POST /invocations`

Invocation features:

- JSON response
- SSE response when `Accept: text/event-stream` or `?stream=true`
- `agent_session_id` query parameter
- JSON body:
  - `{ "message": "..." }`
  - `{ "input": "..." }`
- plain text body
- generated `requestId`
- generated `sessionId` when omitted
- `cwd` constrained inside `WORKSPACE_DIR`

## Session mapping

Foundry `agent_session_id` maps to pi session storage:

```text
$SESSIONS_DIR/<sessionId>/pi-sessions
```

The wrapper removes `--no-session` from `PI_ARGS` and adds:

```bash
--continue --session-dir <session-specific-dir>
```

Verified remotely:

1. Ask version 4 to remember `mango`
2. Ask again in same session
3. It returns `mango`

## Runtime directories

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `WORKSPACE_DIR` | pi working directory; Docker defaults to `/workspace` |
| `FILES_DIR` | generated artifact root served by `/artifacts/<path>`; Docker defaults to `/files` |
| `STATE_DIR` | wrapper state root; Docker defaults to `/home/node/.pi-foundry` |
| `SESSIONS_DIR` | per-session pi storage root |
| `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` | pi config/cache/models root |

## Current model/provider setup

The wrapper generates a pi custom provider named `foundry` when `PI_OPENAI_API_KEY` is present.

Current real remote settings:

```bash
PI_MOCK=0
PI_ARGS="--mode rpc --no-session --provider foundry --model gpt-5.4-mini"
PI_OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://zihch-test-wus3-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/v1"
PI_OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-5.4-mini"
PI_OPENAI_API_KEY=<stored in local azd env, not in repo>
```

Important endpoint finding:

- `https://zihch-test-wus3-resource.services.ai.azure.com/openai/v1` works locally but failed from Hosted Agent sandbox with `fetch failed`.
- `https://zihch-test-wus3-resource.cognitiveservices.azure.com/openai/v1` works from Hosted Agent sandbox and is the current deployed endpoint.

## azd environment

Environment name:

```bash
pi-foundry-local
```

Important azd values:

```bash
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="fcffb5eb-7227-412b-b730-094a0dc8d815"
AZURE_TENANT_ID="d678d95f-6390-442d-a5db-742082adc9cf"
AZURE_LOCATION="westus3"
FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://zihch-test-wus3-resource.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/zihch-test-wus3"
AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ID="/subscriptions/fcffb5eb-7227-412b-b730-094a0dc8d815/resourceGroups/rg-zihch-test/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/zihch-test-wus3-resource/projects/zihch-test-wus3"
AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT="zihchpifoundry.azurecr.io"
```

The secret `PI_OPENAI_API_KEY` is stored in `.azure/pi-foundry-local/.env`. The `.azure/` directory is ignored and should not be committed.

## Azure resources

Existing Foundry endpoint supplied by user:

```text
https://zihch-test-wus3-resource.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/zihch-test-wus3
```

Container registry created during this work:

```text
zihchpifoundry.azurecr.io
```

ACR permissions were required for Foundry image pulls. Assigned ACR pull/read roles to:

- Foundry project system identity
- Foundry project agent identity
- hosted agent instance identity
- hosted agent blueprint identity

## Known-good commands

Local backend-only run:

```bash
cd ~/repos/pi-foundry
PI_MOCK=1 npm run start:backend
```

Local smoke:

```bash
npm run smoke
```

Docker build:

```bash
npm run docker:build
```

Docker smoke:

```bash
npm run runtime:smoke
npm run smoke
```

Official SDK local smoke:

```bash
npm run smoke
```

Remote deploy:

```bash
azd deploy --no-prompt
```

Remote invocation, known-good real version:

```bash
azd ai agent invoke pi-foundry \
  --protocol invocations \
  --version 4 \
  --new-session \
  --timeout 600 \
  'Say exactly: ok'
```

Expected output includes:

```json
{
  "output": "ok",
  "mock": false
}
```

Remote logs:

```bash
azd ai agent monitor pi-foundry --tail 100 --type console
```

Show status:

```bash
azd ai agent show --output json --no-prompt
azd ai agent doctor --no-prompt
```

## Current doctor state

Last checked after version 4 deployment:

```text
11 passed, 0 failed, 3 skipped, 1 warned
```

Warning:

```text
Agent identity role assignments: could not list role assignments
```

This is not a blocker; remote real invocation works.

## Important implementation notes

- Foundry reserves `FOUNDRY_*` and `AGENT_*` environment variable prefixes. Use `PI_*` names for custom env vars.
- Foundry requires `GET /readiness` to return HTTP 200.
- Foundry Hosted Agent internal port convention is `8088`; `Dockerfile.runtime` and the demo Dockerfile expose `8088`.
- Current Foundry-facing implementation uses the official Python `azure-ai-agentserver-invocations` SDK.
- The Node process is retained as the internal Pi backend for RPC lifecycle, sessions, streaming, and artifacts.

## Known issues / next work

1. `/diagnostics` is now disabled by default. Set `ENABLE_DIAGNOSTICS=1` to enable it temporarily.
2. `PI_OPENAI_API_KEY` is stored in local azd env. User said Key Vault is not needed yet.
3. `/artifacts/<path>` can serve generated files from `FILES_DIR` locally, but Foundry front door does not expose that route. Remote artifacts are published to Azure Storage Static Website instead.
4. Upload/workspace ingestion is still not implemented.
5. No concurrency limits yet.
6. No explicit output truncation in the internal backend, though pi tools already truncate their own tool output.
7. Multiple old remote versions exist; prefer the current skill-managed deployment output version.
